# LCE - Contains Duplicate

## Summary

> [!WARNING] Important
> For anyone who is reading this document, titled "LCE - Contains Duplicate", please note that this structure will be apparent throughout all documents that cover LeetCode problems, whether they are LCE, LCM, or LCH. This document structure will ensure consistency across our documentation, making it easier for others to navigate and learn (from what I an other coding buddies are able to do). Additionally, this structure will also provide better semantics for our search engine to retrieve relevant documents more efficiently.


This section will go over a simple introduction/summary introducing the LeetCode problem (with its respective link), going over "thinking out loud" blocks and summarizing the content for the LeetCode problem.

### Problem Statement & Link

This section goes over the specific problem that will be analyzed, including a direct link to the LeetCode problem, and any formal introduction of the task.

- **LeetCode Link**: [Contains Duplicate - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/description/)
- **Problem Description**: Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if any value appears **at least twice** in the array, and return `false` if every element is distinct.
- Recommended Time & Space Complexity: `O(n)` time, `O(n)` space.

> [!NOTE] Thinking Out Loud
> This question was the first LeetCode question to go through following NeetCode 150. The problem is fairly simple, checking whether any value within the array `nums` appears more than once, and returns a `bool`. The difficult part is actually trying to figure out what mistakes we want to avoid since this is a very straightforward answer (even without the provided hints).

## Mistakes to Avoid

This section highlights the common pitfalls that one might experience when solving this problem. Mistakes are separated into `syntax` related  and `pattern` specific mistakes.
1. Pattern specific mistakes are often logic or algorithm errors.
2. Syntax specific mistakes are often related to the programming language used to solve the LeetCode problem.

### Syntax Related

1. [[LCSV001 - Incorrect Set Initialization]]

### Pattern Specific

2. [[LCPV001 - Brute Force Loops]]

### LeetCode Question Mindmap

This section outlines the decision-making progress through a mindmap. We will consider using a visual mindmap tool in conjunction with this document to map out patterns of thought when solving the LeetCode problem. For brief, we will provide a textual representation that will be helpful for quick reference:
1. **Problem Type**: LCE
2. **Possible Patterns**:
3. **Chosen Pattern**:
	1. *Why does this pattern make sense over others?*
4. **Pre-requisites**:
