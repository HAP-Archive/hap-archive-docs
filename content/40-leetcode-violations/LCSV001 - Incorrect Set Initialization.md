# LeetCode Violation: LCSV001

## Summary

> [!WARNING] Important
> This guide defines a set of conventional rules and violations for common algorithm patterns and language-specific syntax often encountered while solving LeetCode problems. Each rule will always have a unique code, an explanation of what the code is checking for, and a justifications for why this code is important.

This violation, **LCSVR001: Incorrect Set Initialization**, addresses a language specific syntax required to create empty sets for LeetCode problems that require sets. A common mistake is to use an initializer that creates a different structure entirely (like dictionaries, or lists), leading to errors.

### What Does it Do?

> [!TIP] FYI
> This section provides a brief, high-level summary of the code pattern, anti-pattern, or behavior that this rule is designed to detect. It answers the fundamental question: "What condition triggers this violation?"

This rule flags the use of using incorrect syntax for creating sets. It's triggered when a developer used a literal or constructor in a non-set object, which would eventually fail when set-specific methods are called on it.

1. Python (`*.py`) example: `seen_elements = set()`
2. C# (`*.cs`) example: `ISet<T> seenElements = new HashSet<T>();`
3. JavaScript (`*.js`) example: `let seenElements = new Set()`
### Why is it Bad?

> [!TIP] FYI 
> This section explains the negative consequences of the flagged code, justifying why it is considered an anti-pattern or a mistake. The reasoning typically focuses on performance bottlenecks (e.g., causing "Time Limit Exceeded" errors), correctness issues (bugs and logical errors), or deviations from established programming best practices.

When it comes to initialization, failing to create a set will lead to guaranteed runtime errors. A specific program will attempt to run a set-specific operation on an object of a different type, which will cause the application to crash.
