# LeetCode Violation: <% tp.file.title %>

## Summary

> [!WARNING] Important
> This guide defines a set of conventional rules and violations for common algorithm patterns and language-specific syntax often encountered while solving LeetCode problems. Each rule will always have a unique code, an explanation of what the code is checking for, and a justifications for why this code is important.

### What Does it Do?

> [!TIP] FYI
> This section provides a brief, high-level summary of the code pattern, anti-pattern, or behavior that this rule is designed to detect. It answers the fundamental question: "What condition triggers this violation?"

### Why is it Bad?

> [!TIP] FYI 
> This section explains the negative consequences of the flagged code, justifying why it is considered an anti-pattern or a mistake. The reasoning typically focuses on performance bottlenecks (e.g., causing "Time Limit Exceeded" errors), correctness issues (bugs and logical errors), or deviations from established programming best practices.
